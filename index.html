                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My obsession with sports began at a very young age as my family lineage possesses a rich history of success in athletics. My great-grandfather is a hall-of-fame football player at North Dakota State University, my grandfather played football at the University of Kansas, and my father was a member of the 1990 national championship football team here at the University of Colorado. Being born a triplet, I have competed for everything I have earned in my life. Every day of my childhood was a competition between my siblings and me whether it be in the classroom, at home, or on the field. I graduated from Torrey Pines High School in San Diego, California which is the top-ranked public school for athletics in the state. During my time at Torrey Pines, I played junior varsity football and varsity lacrosse on the only nationally ranked team in the western United States, winning 2 San Diego Section CIF titles before my senior season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
